#+TITLE: ppv - Python Plate Vetting

Tools for dealing with SDSS-V plate files and plate runs.
* Installation
** Setup environment (optional, but recommended)
If fulfilling the [[*Requirements]] seems daunting and you run the conda package manager, you can set up a python environment that will happily install `ppv` with
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
conda env create -f ppv_sdss_min.yml
   #+END_SRC
   and activate the environment with

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
conda activate ppv
   #+END_SRC
Once you have activated your environment, proceed to clone and install!


** Clone this repository and install
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git clone https://github.com/jcbird/ppv.git
   #+END_SRC

   and, to install the `ppv` package

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    python setup.py install
   #+END_SRC

** Requirements
   - python (>3.5, 3.8 preferred) [if this frightens you, read on]
   - astropy
   - [[https://github.com/jcbird/ppv.git][pydl]] (development version)
